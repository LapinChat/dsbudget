Performed on an iMac, running OS X Version 10.5.8, 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo.

== Prerequisite ==
Install the latest Java (1.6.0).

== Installation ==
1. Download .zip file.
  This will normally download to the "Downloads" folder.
  
2. Double click.zip file.
  This will create a "dsbudget_2.0.12" folder in the download folder.
  
3. Drag the "dsbudget_2.0.12" to the Applications folder.
  # Open Finder.
  # Double click on your downloads folder (so you have 2 finder windows open).
  # Drop the folder from the Downloads folder to the Applications Folder.

The program is now "installed."

== Running the program ==

The next part might seem technical, but i made it very simplistic.

1. You need to open the Terminal program.
  # In Applications, scroll to Utilities.
  # Select Terminal.
2. Type the following lines (excluding the line numbers, but including the spaces).
  # cd /Applications
  # cd dsbudget_2.0.12
  # /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/versions/1.6.0/Home/bin/java -jar dsbudget.jar
  This should open the program in your default browser.  Step 3. is long to make sure you are running the correct version of Java.

== Ending the program ==

  # Close your browser (file should save as you go...).
  # Select the "Terminal" program.  It should be somewhere on the desktop.
  # Close the Terminal program.
  It will ask you to confirm.  Select "Close."
